News Article Scraper

This specific Python program is designed to take it multiple news artucle URL's and then scrap the text. After the program has scrapped the text, it makes sure there is a directory names articles. The program then stores files containing the content into "articles". To finalize the program, it outputs the files that have been downloaded.

In order to parse the text, this program uses libraries of requests, beautiful soup, and os. The program cuts into the title, headers, and body, using the HTML content used in the files.
